## What This Is About

I have this Pinebook Pro and want to build u-boot firmware for it. But I'd
rather cross-compile and test it out in qemu, rather than have to fiddle with
booting the real hardware every time.

So I want to set up a cross-compilation environment for `aarch64` (arm64) that
will let me do that (even if I can't build for every possible hardware target
with every possible feature).

I'm going to try to do this with WSL in Windows, even though I'm not sure this
is really the best option. (A dev container or VM might be more suitable.)

## What I'm Using

Windows Subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu 22.

```bash

> hostnamectl  status
...
         Chassis: container
...
  Virtualization: wsl
Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
          Kernel: Linux 6.6.87.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
    Architecture: x86-64

> wsl.exe --version
WSL version: 2.5.7.0
Kernel version: 6.6.87.1-1
WSLg version: 1.0.66
...
Windows version: 10.0.26100.4351

```

## What I'm Doing

I'll try to get all these steps in the right order according to how I'm doing
things.

### Clone u-boot Repo

```bash

git clone https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git

git checkout v2025.07-rc5

```

I figure that ought to be very recent without being too unstable. (Usually rc5
or rc6 is the last rc before release.)

### Add arm64 to `dpkg`

It gets annoying, but some things use the name `arm64` to identify the ARM
64-bit architecture target, and other things use `aarch64`.  For dpkg
we need:

```bash

> dpkg --add-architecture arm64
> dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
arm64

```

Most other things will refer to ARM architecture as `aarch64` (or the same
with 32 for 32 bit).

I'm not sure how much this will help, but I figure I might as well tell
`dpkg` that it's allowed to install packages for the target platform just
in case it comes in handy.

### Installing Necessary Packages

Here's what I'm installing.

```bash

sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install bc bison build-essential coccinelle \
  device-tree-compiler dfu-util efitools flex gdisk graphviz imagemagick \
  libgnutls28-dev libncurses-dev gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu \
  libpython3-dev libsdl2-dev libssl-dev lz4 lzma lzma-alone openssl \
  pkg-config python3 python3-asteval python3-coverage python3-filelock \
  python3-pkg-resources python3-pycryptodome python3-pyelftools \
  python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist python3-sphinxcontrib.apidoc \
  python3-sphinx-rtd-theme python3-subunit python3-testtools \
  python3-venv swig uuid-dev python3-setuptools

```

The package `libguestfs-tools` is omitted because it depends on `mdadm` which
just hangs in it's install hook script. I'm guessing it wants to add a kernel
module that doesn't work in WSL or something. If preparation to work around
this if needed (probably not needed for what I'm doing):

```bash

sudo apt-add-repository -s
cd <the same directory where I cloned u-boot>
ls .
  u-boot/
sudo apt-get source libguestfs-tools
ls .
  libguestfs-1.46.2                 libguestfs_1.46.2-10ubuntu3.debian.tar.xz
  libguestfs_1.46.2-10ubuntu3.dsc   libguestfs_1.46.2.orig.tar.gz
  u-boot

```

But when dealing with WSL, be prepared to not just be able to install debian
packages for absolutely everything, especially when they are things that
wouldn't likely work in WSL.

Additionally you may need (or at least want) these:

```bash

sudo apt-get install arm-trusted-firmware-tools bsdutils bsdextrautils \
  bzip2 clang gdb-multiarch gdbserver git \
  qemu qemu-system qemu-user qemu-utils xz-utils

```

(I'm mostly interested in the qemu there.)

### Set Env Variables

This is the main one that needs to be set:

```bash

export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

```

(Notice the `aarch64` this time.)

Or don't set the environment variable and invoke `make` like this every time
as needed:

```bash

CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make <target_name>

```

Optional things to set if you want to try using `clang`:

```bash

export HOSTCC=clang
export CC=clang

```

You can also use a specific output directory by adding `O=` as in `O=/tmp/build/artifacts`
as an argument to the `make` command.

Use `V=1` (or a larger number) for more verbose make output.

Also, run `make help` in the u-boot top level directory to get some text output
about what targets are available and what they're for.

## Cleaning

- `make clean` - removes most things but doesn't delete `.config`
- `make mrproper` - same as clean plus removes `.config` and some caches
- `make distclean` - absolute maximum clean

Running some level of clean is important if you change any configuration.
If only the `.config` is changed then regular `clean` should be good
enough. If you change `O=` then `mrproper` will be needed.

## Test Build

Try this first.

Use `unset CROSS_COMPILE` if set as an env var, because the
sandbox tests just use native compilation. (Optionally
add the `O=` or `V=` to the below if you want.)

```bash

> make mrproper
> make qtest

....
```

This will generate a `.config` using `sandbox_defconfig` from the `configs/`
directory, then run a bunch of tests.

Don't be surprised if some fail though because you may still be lacking some
dependencies, and this tries to test every feature used on any platform. So
whatever failures happen may not even be relevant for your target hardware.

## Build a Boot Firmware for Real Hardware (Pinebook Pro)

Before I start I really need to read the device-specific docs. Even with the
docs it can be difficult to know what they're actually talking about, because
unfortunately whoever is usually writing this stuff seems to be writing it
for an audience who already knows everything.

But enough complaining, here are the main ones for this Pinebook Pro:

- https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/arch/arm64.html
- https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/board/rockchip/rockchip.html

The generic architecture doc isn't too useful for me yet, but the second
one has build instructions.

"Pinebook Pro" isn't listed, but I know it's using a rk3399 SoC and I know
there's a `pinebook-pro-rk3399_defconfig` in `configs/` so whatever build
instructions are helpful for rk3399 should be helpful to me.

### TF-A (trusted-firmware-a)

There's nothing in the above doc to tell you what this is or why you need it,
but at least there are some build instructions, which is a big time saver.

From within my working base directory, which contains my `u-boot` directory:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/TrustedFirmware-A/trusted-firmware-a.git
cd trusted-firmware-a
make realclean
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=rk3399
........build messages spew........
cd ..

```

And thankfully that works like a charn. I now have `trusted-firmware-a/build/rk3399/release/bl31/bl31.elf`
which I will soon need.

#### What BL31.elf Actually Is

Simple answer: This is some stock ARM BSP (Board Support Package) firmware for
the ARM IP (chip design) used by Rockchip on this particular model of chip
(rk3399). The design won't work without it, and it's not worth rewriting a
different version of it if the source code is available, so people just use
this.

More complicated answer: This is a particularly critical part of the firmware
that executes at a maximum "super supervisor" privilege level (EL3 or [Exception
Level](https://krinkinmu.github.io/2021/01/04/aarch64-exception-levels.html) 3) where it can mediate access to registers and functions that
less-priviledged software (such as an operating system) or less privileged
firmware (like u-boot) shouldn't be able to access directly. This includes
things like the power, reset, and execution state of the CPU cores and the
"master control blocks" themselves.

Therefore it makes sense to use the smallest most solid computer program
possible to control access to these sorts of functions and restrict them
appropriately. Without a solid security mechanism, "rootkit" software could
make itself invisible then do anything to anything by having the most
unrestricted access to everything's state.

Thus the name "trusted" to indicate that it occupies such a priviledged
position, trusted with the most critical functions, that everthing it does is
assumed to be secure by the rest of the design. That doesn't mean it's actually
completely secure, but if this is compromised then everything is. So it has to
be trusted and seriously needs to be trustworthy.

To prevent tampering, ideally this kind of thing (like the rest of the firmware)
should only be loaded and executed by a SoC if it has a digital signature that
should only be verifiable if the firmware has been approved by the owner,
manufacturer, etc. But the Pinebook Pro doesn't come with these features
enabled, and I have read that this particular Rockchip design (rk3399) might not
be able to verify firmware signatures properly or something.

So it's one of the things I want to get to the bottom of eventually.

Anyway, more information on the BL31 functions are here:
- [Arm Trusted firmware BL31](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102337/0000/Software-stack/Application-processor-firmware/Arm-Trusted-firmware-BL31)

But what it amounts to is that it controls access by other firmware to
critical system functions. (For a request to actually get here, it actually
has to go through other firmware that an OS is allowed to communicate with.)

So, unlike [BL1](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102337/0000/Software-stack/Application-processor-firmware/Arm-Trusted-firmware-BL1)
(which is permanently burned into the chip) any firmware needs to include
something for the BL31 function and it might as well be the official firmware.

### `make` the Config (.config)

First everything needs to be clean, then `make something_defconfig` where
`something_defconfig` is one of the device default config files in `configs/`.

```bash

> make distclean
....
> make -j8 pinebook-pro-rk3399_defconfig
... blabla make output blabla....
#
# configuration written to .config
#
```

In my case, the defconfig file is `pinebook-pro-rk3399_defconfig`.

That will create `.config` in the current directory (u-boot top level) based on
the default configuration for the Pinebook Pro.

### Tamper With, uh, I mean Improve, the Config

If you ran `make help` you might have noticed this.

```bash

> cd u-boot/
> make help

...
Configuration targets:
  config          - Update current config utilising a line-oriented program
  nconfig         - Update current config utilising a ncurses menu based program
  menuconfig      - Update current config utilising a menu based program
  xconfig         - Update current config utilising a Qt based front-end
  gconfig         - Update current config utilising a GTK+ based front-end
.....blabla...

```

These launch various options for editing the `.config` file to change the
options from the defaults that were copied from the `_defconfig` file for your
device.

In my opinion, the best one to use is `make nconfig` because it provides easy
access to all the options. `menuconfig` is essentially just a color version of
`nconfig` with less convenient keymappings.

I don't want to bother to install the dependencies needed to compile the GUI
equivalents, so I'm ignoring those. `config` is very inconvenient because it
will just ask you to confirm pretty much all settings, one after the other, and
there are zillions of options.

So unless `xconfig` or `gconfig` just instantly work in your environment,
pretty much every option besides `nconfig` or `menuconfig` is a waste of time.

Some usage notes:

#### nconfig

Use F2 to get some explanation of a the currently selected setting, hit F6 to
save the config, and you can search for settings with F8. Esc also works as F5
"Back".

#### menuconfig

Use ? for the same function as F2, and Esc does _not_ work as "Back".

#### What to Not Change

Two main bits of advice:

- A bunch of settings are characteristics of the target device that can't be
  changed unless you want to see it lock up or never do anything to begin with.
  These are usually pretty obvious like "Enable ARM Architecture" and "Support
  Rockchip RK3399" for example, but some are more obscure. Try to use some
  common sense.

- Some settings might normally be perfectly fine to enable, but the feature is
  broken for your particular device, or there's a dependent feature that doesn't
  automatically get enabled and you didn't know. So you can end up with some
  configurations that prevent the firmware from building, or that just lock up
  after boothing. For this reason it's not a good idea to change too many things
  before testing, otherwise it may be difficult to figure out what caused a
  problem.

- If there's a build error, check any related settings that you changed to see
  if it's caused by that.

So just keep in mind that not all combinations of all options are guaranteed to
work even when the options seem unrelated. Not every feature is "there yet" on
every platform.

In short, don't expect any of the config to be idiot-proof.

### Use U-Boot TPL or Vendor "TPL"?

Just "one more thing" for the Nth time....

There are still two environment variables I need to set for the Pinebook Pro
before starting the build.

One is optional if you don't mind "suspend to RAM" (sleep) not working properly
on the Pinebook Pro. But if you do want this working:

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin
cd u-boot
```

This will clone the closed-source firmware driver binaries from Rockchip, one
of which is `rkbin/bin/rk33/px30_ddr_333MHz_v1.16.bin`.

To use this as part of the image at the end of the build, we need to set
`ROCKCHIP_TPL` to the correct file.

To [explain this and the boot process](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/RK3399_boot_sequence#U-Boot_boot_sequence)
a little better, these are the different firmware images that get executed at
boot:

1. **BROM** - Boot ROM, can't be changed, burned into the chip, is the first thing
   to start executing. This initializes the SoC (System on a Chip), that is the
   whole RK3399 (or at least things that need immediate setup like clocks, etc).
2. **TPL** - Tertiary Program Loader (u-boot terminology) - this initializes
   DRAM and returns control to the BROM. Not much else happens here. (u-boot can
   be configured to try adding a few extra things here when it builds this
   part.)
3. **SPL** - Secondary Program Loader (u-boot term) - Loaded and executed by
   BROM after the TPL returns. Now that RAM should all be working, this loads up
   the remaining firmware, that being TF-A and u-boot, then executes TF-A.
4. **TF-A** - The Trusted Firmware A for the BL31 block on the chip which runs
   at EL3 (Exception Level 3, highest privilege). Once it's done initializing it
   drops the EL to EL2 and then executes u-boot. It then stays resident, and
   remains dormant until something asks it to do something requiring EL3
   privileges.
5. **u-boot** - Finally, after all that rigamarole, u-boot gets to start at EL2.
   Only here do we actually get to what you think of as a normal OS boot loader.
   Once done with it's stuff, it drops to EL1 and loads an OS kernel to execute
   at EL1. (The OS could still execute stuff, like a hypervisor, at EL2 if it's
   allowed to.)

So basically the vendor image `px30_ddr_333MHz_v1.16.bin` is a complete
replacement for what u-boot would ordinary supply as "TPL".

The only reason why you wouldn't want to just use u-boot's TPL is if it is, say,
lacking functions needed for "sleep mode" to work properly on your device.

So even though I'd like source code for this, I think I'll just use the vendor's
TPL for now and see how it works. At least I was able to build the TP-A image
from source.

```bash

cd u-boot
export ROCKCHIP_TPL=../rkbin/bin/rk33/px30_ddr_333MHz_v1.16.bin
export BL31=../trusted-firmware-a/build/rk3399/release/bl31/bl31.elf

```

### Finally... Run the Build

After all that trouble, I'm ready to continue.

```bash

make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8

```

Woohoo! Success! Worked on the first try. Probably only worked smoothly because
I'm going through the process slowly enough to write all of this up.

## Pick Through The Artifacts

The successful build process left us with lots of stuff, including:

```bash

> ls -l *.img *.bin *.itb
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone  397312 Jun 30 02:44 idbloader-spi.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone  198656 Jun 30 02:44 idbloader.img

-rwxr-xr-x 1 rjstone rjstone  970856 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot-nodtb.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone 2149888 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot-rockchip-spi.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone 9588224 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot-rockchip.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone 1068616 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone 1069612 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 rjstone rjstone 1232384 Jun 30 02:44 u-boot.itb

```

I know I'm supposed to be able to flash either `idbloader.img` and `u-boot.bin`
or just `u-boot-rockchip.bin`, but what is all this stuff?



## Flashing/Writing The Boot Loader

**Warning:** Don't just assume the memory layout of a firmware/boot loader image
and just write it using the offsets shown below, even if the filenames look
similar. Similar images that come with different OS distributions may contain
other stuff, like disk partition information, intended to be written from offset
0 but overwriting the partition table. In short, make sure you know what an
image contains and what offset it should be written at before writing it.
Otherwise you end up writing data where code is expected.

### Disk-like Boot Devices and Disk Images

If we use the single image then we need to write it to the boot image or
device like this:

```bash

sudo dd if=u-boot-rockchip.bin of=<boot file or /dev device> seek=64
sync

```

The `seek=64` will skip 64 x 512B blocks in the output, or 32,768 bytes from the
beginning.

If we need to write the seperate `.img` and `.idb` files, it should be done
like this:

```bash

sudo dd if=/boot/idbloader.img conv=notrunc seek=64    of=<dev or disk img>
sudo dd if=/boot/u-boot.itb    conv=notrunc seek=16384 of=<dev or disk img>

```

The single image ends up putting these at the same offsets when the whole thing
is written starting from `seek=64`:

```bash
> hexdump  u-boot-rockchip.bin -s 0x30690  | head -10
0030690 0074 6976 2d6e 7573 7070 796c 0000 0000
00306a0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*
0030800 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
*
07f8000 0dd0 edfe 0000 000c 0000 3800 0000 c80a
07f8010 0000 2800 0000 1100 0000 0200 0000 0000
07f8020 0000 c800 0000 900a 0000 0000 0000 0000
07f8030 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 0000 0000
07f8040 0000 0300 0000 0400 0000 a200 6268 735c
```

So idbloader.img (the first part) ends at about `0x3069a` (in this build), then
is filled with all 1's (0xFF) until `0x7F800`, then the u-boot.itb part starts.
(All 1's is the state of erased sdcard flash.)

So that just saves some trouble, but it's the same thing in offset terms.

### Writing to SPI Flash and "Not Disk" MTD Flash

#### Don't Do It

The first reason why anyone who's a "noob" to this kind of thing (including
me) shouldn't do this on a Pinebook Pro is that SPI has the highest boot
priority, and if it's programmed with something that looks like it can boot,
but actually locks the machine, then the PBP is semi-hard bricked and can't
be unbricked without disabling the SPI flash chip somehow.

#### SDcards Are Convenient

When testing out bootloaders on actual hardware, for the Pinebook Pro the
easiest option is to erase the SPI (if there's anything there), erase the
firmware areas of the internal eMMC, and just always boot from SDCard while
you're tinkering.

That's because the SDcard can be easily removed and reflashed, but it's less
convenient to disble the eMMC (internal switch) and even more inconvenient to
disable the SPI flash (need soldering iron).

### How It's Done, Approximately

I don't really want to provide directions for doing this mostly because I
haven't done it myself, but unlike eMMC and sdcard devices, things like SPI
flash chips are usually programmed with special utilities like
[Linux MTD Utilities](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/general.html).

The reason for this is that "MTD" flash devices are "raw" and "dumb" flash chips
that don't do any automatic mapping of blocks for wear balancing, or automatic
detection and unmapping of bad blocks. Software has to do that when programming
them.

SDcards, USB flash drives, etc, all contain controllers that do this kind of
smart stuff to create a translation layer in hardware that looks like a reliable
block device. Under the hood, physical blocks are being remapped all over the
place internally to avoid burning out the same physical blocks when the same
logical block keeps getting overwritten.

So trying to just `dd` to one of these devices would be a bad idea even if it
were possible, because bad blocks wouldn't be detected, if nothing else.

### Pinebook Pro SPI Info

Here are some links:

* [Pine64 Wiki: Pinebook Pro SPI](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinebook_Pro#Using_the_SPI_flash_device)
* [postmarkerOS Wiki: Pinebook Pro](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/PINE64_Pinebook_Pro_(pine64-pinebookpro)#Flashing_u-boot_to_the_SPI)
* [Pine64 Wiki: RK3399 Boot Sequence](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/RK3399_boot_sequence#U-Boot_boot_sequence)

### SPI Images

You will also notice that there are separate images built for SPI flash, like
`u-boot-rockchip-spi.bin`, which you might also notice is much smaller than
`u-boot-rockchip.bin`. That's because it doesn't have the same huge 0xFF hole in
the middle as the offsets are not the same for booting from SPI flash.

There's a bit of a hole in that one, but not in the same location or as large:

```bash
0060680 6f74 2d72 616d 2d78 696d 7263 766f 6c6f
0060690 0074 6976 2d6e 7573 7070 796c 0000 0000
00606a0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*
0061000 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff

00e0020 0000 bf00 0000 780a 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

## Finishing Up

That's it for this episode.

In the next episode, I'll go over booting u-boot in qemu (though it
won't be exactly the same pinebook pro rockchip image).
