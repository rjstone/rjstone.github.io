### FaTOS: The Fake-Time Operating System

Some very small microcontrollers, like the STC89 series (an Intel 8052 clone),
don't really have all of the modern resources and interrupt handling that you
might want for a real operating system, but at least they do have more than one
timer and a few bytes of RAM.

Look for blog posts about it using the [fatos tag](/tags/fatos/).
