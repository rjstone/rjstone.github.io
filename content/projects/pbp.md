I have this [Pinebook Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinebook_pro/) that I
bought because it's an inexpensive ARM computer, similar to a Chromebook, but
intended to primarily run Linux and not a particular vendor's OS.

But I don't just want to boot and use Manjaro, so getting it installed with
exactly what I want is a bit of a project. The objective is to get it to boot
two different operating systems from eMMC with some u-boot special features that
I want.
