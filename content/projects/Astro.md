"Astro is a JavaScript web framework optimized for building fast, content-driven
websites."

I'm working on learning to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) so I can fancy up
this site a bit.

I picked this because it can be used to generate entirely static sites for
things like GitHub Pages, but can also support back-end code like serverless
functions (just in case I ever need any back-end stuff).
