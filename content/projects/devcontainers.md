I've been working on creating Development Container Images for some specific
purposes, like HDL EDA tools, that are a bit more specialized than usual. What
I've done so far is in
[rjstone/devcontainers](https://github.com/rjstone/devcontainers). I intend to
also create "devcontainer features" and devcontainer templates but haven't
done so yet.
