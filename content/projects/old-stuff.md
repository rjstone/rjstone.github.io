### discord-webhook-notify GitHub Action

I created
[this discord notification action](https://github.com/rjstone/discord-webhook-notify)
for GitHub's CI stuff.

### Papyrus Language Tools

I helped out a little bit with the
[Papyrus Language Tools](https://github.com/rjstone/papyrus-lang) VSCode
extension. (This is a language used by Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout
4.)

### The "Code Your Own Site" Page

[Code Your Own Site](https://cyos.rjstone.net/) is some instructions I created a
long time ago because a bunch of the older kids (and some adults) learning about
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Khan Academy wanted ideas on how to create a web
site. Unfortunately this is a bit out of date and there still aren't any ideal
options that are easy for new learners.

### Codepens

I created [a few codepins](https://codepen.io/rjstone/pens/popular) a long time
ago.
