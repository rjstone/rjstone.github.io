# rjstone.net

This is my humble yet oh-so-informative personal site which is built using ðŸš€ [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the <a href="https://nordlys.fjelloverflow.dev"><img alt="logo" src="./public/nordlys.svg" height="16"> Nordlys</a> template.

It might be easier to just [view the web site](https://rjstone.net) instead of reading the code.

(I would also like to thank [FjellOverflow](https://github.com/FjellOverflow) for making the template available, because I'm _not_ a full stack developer and it would otherwise take me quite a bit of time to create this sort of Astro template.)
